The Rust programming language helps you write faster, more reliable software. High-level ergonomics and low-level control are often at odds in programming language design; Rust challenges that conflict. Through balancing powerful technical capacity and a great developer experience, Rust gives you the option to control low-level details (such as memory usage) without all the hassle traditionally associated with such control.

Rust also brings contemporary developer tools to the systems programming world:
-   Cargo, the included dependency manager and build tool, makes adding, compiling, and managing dependencies painless and consistent across the Rust ecosystem.
-   Rustfmt ensures a consistent coding style across developers.
-   The Rust Language Server powers Integrated Development Environment (IDE) integration for code completion and inline error messages.
